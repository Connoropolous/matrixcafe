# matrix cafe

matrix cafe is an exploration of an open space on the internet.
matrix cafe is for hanging out with people, sharing space, and experiencing serendipitous and fun connection online. 
its an exploration of the future of social networking beyond posts, "friends", and chat, in the direction that virtual reality is also going to go.

matrix cafe should be a safe space of welcoming everyone.

all video streaming, and realtime data transmission occurs via WebRTC, meaning that it happens strictly peer-to-peer.

matrix cafe is at this point, just a very early concept and being tested out for interest. there will likely be many technical issues, but I will happily work to resolve them, and improve this if there's demand.

matrix cafe may only work really well, or at all, on the Chrome browser.
